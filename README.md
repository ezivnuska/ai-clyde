# chat-bot Framework

A framework in the making where a developer can without code spin up a chat bot with it`s own brain with few available situations 


The features of the chat bot would be :
1. easily customizable
2. can process JSON Requests and Responses
3. Handle actions differently from the user talking to the bot

The Tech Stack used to make it would include:

1. This is the source code for a very simple chat example used for 
the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide 
of the Socket.IO website.


2. This includes code from RiveScript https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-js
